// Implement Stack using array in c
// It works on LIFO
// Last in First Out
// Means The book which is last entered will be first to be exit
// ORR.............
// LOFI
// The book which is entered first will be exit last
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Operations to be made to Implement Stack ------->
// Only Top most element will be accessed in Stack
// There is a push operation which add elements to array at top position to stack
// There is a pop operation which remove elements from the top poistion of stack
// There is top operation which gives the element present at top most position
// There is a size operation which returns size of Stack
// There is empty operation which tells either stack is empty or not
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
